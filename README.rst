segmentation_net
=================
Segmentation_net is a high-level neural networks API for image segmentation based on the sucess of fully convolutionnal networks.
Segmentation_net provides essential classes as building blocks for segmentation networks. it implements the necessary functions to have fast implementation of queues for the tensorflow models. Many data augmentation that can be applied to an image and to it's corresponding label. Finally it's organisation allows a user to modify independantly some crucial aspects of the whole model easily.
Indeed, the core class segmentation_net posses many methods.
